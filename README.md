### Projects

#### Machine Learning

1. **Predicting lymph node status in thyroid microcarcinoma patients.** Evaluated multiple supervised machine learning methods (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to implement a gene expression based classifier. The best calssifier was selected based on positive predictive value, which was considered more important than accuracy by clinicians.

2. **Characterizing mutations and artifacts in DNA sequencing data.** The goal of the project was to identify a semi-supervised machine learning alternative the the existing supervised classifier (random forest) to make use of unlabeled data because of the high cost involved in curating a large training set.
